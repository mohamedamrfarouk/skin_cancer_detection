# skin_cancer_detection
this project is skin cancer detection using deep Learning
It classify between 3 classes 1: melanoma 
                              2: nevus
                              3: seborrheic_keratosis
                              
I used inception_v3_weights_tf_dim_ordering_tf_kernels_notop and it gives good accuracy
I also used tkinter GUI to test the project by browsing and getting the picture from pc
